MySQL installation
- install MySQL for your OS (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- during installation, set the password for the `root` user as `cs6400mysql`. If you set a different password, you'll need to edit the `main.py` file when you run locally.
- choose "Run MySQL after installation", or start up MySQL after installation completes.
- install and open MySQLWorkbench (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- create a new MySQL Connection by selecting the (+) button
    - you can pick any connection name
    - leave Hostname as "127.0.0.1", Port as "3306", Username as "root"
    - enter "cs6400mysql" for the password, "cs6400" for the Default Schema
- in the new window, you should see the "cs6400" schema listed on the left
- in the query field, enter all CREATE TABLE statements from Phase_2, and click the lightning bolt icon to run the statements

Python installation
- install Miniconda for your OS (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). You can use the latest Python version (3.9)
- on the command line:
    - make sure your conda install is up to date: run `conda update conda`
    - create a new environment: run `conda create -n <env_name> python=3.7`
        - replace <env_name> with the name of your choice
    - activate your new environment: run `conda activate <env_name>`
    - install the required python packages:
        - run `conda install flask`
        - run `pip install flask-mysql`

Running the app
- make sure MySQL is running on your computer
- make sure you have the correct python environment running (`conda activate <env_name>`) 
- navigate to the directory with the `main.py` file
- start the application: run `FLASK_APP=main.py flask run`
- the output should read `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- Enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser to load the app
